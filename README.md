# Visiting Card mini Project
The visiting card generator is a very simple beginner level web app based on PHP's image - text functions.
You can find an article about this here - <a>http://youthhworld.blogspot.com/2017/05/visiting-card-web-app.html</a>
<br/><b>Note: To use this project from my repository - you must download MPDF module folder from <a href ="https://github.com/mpdf/mpdf/tree/v6.0.0"> here </a> and paste it inside pdf folder.
So the directory of mpdf.php file will be visitingCardOEP/pdf/mpdf/mpdf.php</b>
